# 🐜 Ant Colony Simulation Game

A Python-based simulation game that models the behavior of an ant colony. Players observe or interact with an ant society as it gathers food, expands territory, and adapts to environmental challenges.

---

## 🎮 Game Overview

**Ant Colony** is a simulation game where you manage or simulate an intelligent ant colony. The ants exhibit swarm intelligence, foraging behavior, pheromone trails, and colony roles (workers, soldiers, queen). Built using Python with a focus on educational value and emergent behavior.

## 🌐 Features

- 🧜‍ Colony-based AI with emergent behavior
- 💱 Resource management: forage for food, build tunnels
- ⚔️ Combat system for defense against threats (e.g., spiders)
- 🌍 Dynamic map generation
- ⚖️ Role assignment: workers, soldiers, scouts, queen
- 🌎 Pheromone trail pathfinding
- 🔄 Real-time or turn-based simulation modes

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Pygame

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/your-org/ant-colony-game.git
$ cd ant-colony-game

# Install dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the game
$ python main.py
```

## 🔧 Controls

- **Arrow Keys / WASD**: Move camera or interact
- **Mouse Click**: Select ants or interactable objects
- **Space**: Pause/unpause simulation

---

## 🤺 Gameplay Tips

- Assign roles wisely: scouts explore, workers gather, soldiers defend.
- Use pheromones to guide ant traffic efficiently.
- Expand the colony tunnel to increase storage and security.
